# HTML CSS Refactor

## Description

This project is part of a Challenge assignment. The purpose was to refactor an existing codebase in something called "On-the-job" or "feature request challenges" where a start code located in a [Develop] folder. 
I have learned what type of HTML Semantics there are and how to utilize them to refactor the html into a cleaner and more understandable codebase. This in turn allowed me to clean up and optimize the CSS for the site.

## Usage

This website is intended as a business mainpage for a marketing agency . As a marketing agency, SEO optimization is needed and the codebase follows accessibility standards.
